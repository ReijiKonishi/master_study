  abstract  = "Learning DAG or Bayesian network models is an important problem
               in multi-variate causal inference. However, a number of
               challenges arises in learning large-scale DAG models including
               model identifiability and computational complexity since the
               space of directed graphs is huge. In this paper, we address
               these issues in a number of steps for a broad class of DAG
               models where the noise or variance is signal-dependent. Firstly
               we introduce a new class of identifiable DAG models, where each
               node has a distribution where the variance is a quadratic
               function of the mean (QVF DAG models). Our QVF DAG models
               include many interesting classes of distributions such as
               Poisson, Binomial, Geometric, Exponential, Gamma and many other
               distributions in which the noise variance depends on the mean.
               We prove that this class of QVF DAG models is identifiable, and
               introduce a new algorithm, the OverDispersion Scoring (ODS)
               algorithm, for learning large-scale QVF DAG models. Our
               algorithm is based on firstly learning the moralized or
               undirected graphical model representation of the DAG to reduce
               the DAG search-space, and then exploiting the quadratic variance
               property to learn the ordering. We show through theoretical
               results and simulations that our algorithm is statistically
               consistent in the high-dimensional p > n setting provided that
               the degree of the moralized graph is bounded and performs well
               compared to state-of-the-art DAG-learning algorithms. We also
               demonstrate through a real data example involving multi-variate
               count data, that our ODS algorithm is wellsuited to estimating
               DAG models for count data in comparison to other methods used
               for discrete data.",

  author    = "Pearl, Judea",
  abstract  = "Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this
               book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of
               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 3,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
               understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating

               Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of
               Bayes networks, with results that have been applied in diverse
               areas of research in the social, behavioral, and physical
               sciences. The authors show that although experimental and
               observational study designs may not always permit the same
               inferences, they are subject to uniform principles. They
               axiomatize the connection between causal structure and
               probabilistic independence, explore several varieties of causal
               indistinguishability, formulate a theory of manipulation, and

                   model to understand the data generating process, and have
                   shown that their model is identifiable when the number of

                   continuous and discrete variables coexist in the same
                   problem are common in practice. Most existing causal
                   discovery methods either ignore the discrete data and apply
                   a continuous-valued algorithm or discretize all the
                   continuous data and then apply a discrete Bayesian network

                   novel hybrid causal model which consists of both continuous

                   a continuous variable is a linear function of its parent
                   variables plus a non-Gaussian noise, and (2) each discrete
                   variable is a logistic variable whose distribution
                   parameters depend on the values of its parent variables. In
                   addition, we derive the BIC scoring function for model
                   selection. The new discovery algorithm can learn causal
                   structures from mixed continuous and discrete data without
                   discretization. We empirically demonstrate the power of our

               equation modeling (SEM). LiNGAM is useful as an exploratory
               estimation method for a causal structure. However, the
               assumptions that all observed variables in LiNGAM are continuous
               is not applicable in case of mixed data (i.e., when discrete
               variables are also included in the dataset). Therefore, we
               propose the Latent LiNGAM (L-LiNGAM), where each variable
               corresponds to a continuous latent variable and is observed as
               data through transformation via a link function. In the

               real-world data applications, the causal structure estimated by
               L-LiNGAM is shown to be the best for evaluation under SEM. The

                   assumptions on the data generating process can one infer the
                   causal graph from the joint distribution? The approach taken
                   by conditional independence-based causal discovery methods
                   is based on two assumptions: the Markov condition and
                   faithfulness. It has been shown that under these assumptions
                   the causal graph can be identified up to Markov equivalence
                   (some arrows remain undirected) using methods like the PC
                   algorithm. In this work we propose an alternative by
                   defining Identifiable Functional Model Classes (IFMOCs). As
                   our main theorem we prove that if the data generating
                   process belongs to an IFMOC, one can identify the complete
                   causal graph. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
                   identifiability result of this kind that is not limited to
                   linear functional relationships. We discuss how the IFMOC
                   assumption and the Markov and faithfulness assumptions
                   relate to each other and explain why we believe that the
                   IFMOC assumption can be tested more easily on given data. We
                   further provide a practical algorithm that recovers the
                   causal graph from finitely many data; experiments on
                   simulated data support the theoretical findings.",

  abstract = "We clarify the status of the so-called causal minimality
              condition in the theory of causal Bayesian networks, which has
              received much attention in the recent literature on the
              epistemology of causation. In doing so, we argue that the
              condition is well motivated in the interventionist (or
              manipulability) account of causation, assuming the causal Markov
              condition which is essential to the semantics of causal Bayesian
              networks. Our argument has two parts. First, we show that the
              causal minimality condition, rather than an add-on methodological
              assumption of simplicity, necessarily follows from the
              substantive interventionist theses, provided that the actual
              probability distribution is strictly positive. Second, we
              demonstrate that the causal minimality condition can fail when
              the actual probability distribution is not positive, as is the
              case in the presence of deterministic relationships. But we argue
              that the interventionist account still entails a pragmatic
              justification of the causal minimality condition. Our argument in
              the second part exemplifies a general perspective that we think
              commendable: when evaluating methods for inferring causal
              structures and their underlying assumptions, it is relevant to
              consider how the inferred causal structure will be subsequently
              used for counterfactual reasoning.",

  abstract  = "We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks
               from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data.
               First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing
               informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived
               from a set of assumptions made previously as well as the
               assumption oflikelihood equivalence, which says that data should
               not help to discriminate network structures that represent the
               same assertions of conditional independence. We show that
               likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made
               assumptions implies that the user's priors for network
               parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the
               next case to be seen---aprior network---and a single measure of
               confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show
               how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network
               structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for
               identifying network structures with high posterior
               probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the
               highest-scoring network structures in the special case where
               every node has at mostk=1 parent. For the general case (k>1),
               which is NP-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms
               including local search, iterative local search, and simulated
               annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating
               Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to
